I also get so many compliments when I wear this. It also glides on so softly and feels so pillowy on the lips.',\n",
       " 'I am beyond thrilled that Sephora now carries Charlotte Tilbury! Her makeup has been my beauty secret for years! I have this lipstick in Pillow Talk, Very Victoria, Bond Girl. Pillow Talk exactly mimics my lip color. Very Victoria is more of a nude lip. Bond Girl is the perfect berry/rosy red. Charlotte’s matte lipsticks are the only matte I will use! They do not dry out your lips and have massive staying power! I can’t recommend them enough!',\n",
       " 'I bought Pillow Talk and Very Victoria from CharlotteTilbury online and I am stoked that Sephora is caring the CT Line.\\nBoth colors look amazing on my Medium Olive Complexion; it wears very well, feels creamy and looks matte! \\nWhat else could you ask for.  My favorite lip color line ever .....',\n",
       " \"A luxurious lipstick that is worth it. The shade is my lips but pinker. It's a long lasting matte lipstick but still comfortable to wear. You don't even feel it on your lips. It perfectly pairs with the pillow talk liner.\",\n",
       " 'This is hands down my favorite shade to wear out. Love the shade, it smells like chocolate and has a very rich feel without being overwhelming. \\nSo glad that it’s not a limited edition and that I can get points for it now. \\nI highly recommend this color!',\n",
       " 'Pillow Talk is the perfect color for day or night. So pretty and natural.',\n",
       " \"Bond Girl Color is very pretty and natural looking red. It feels very comfortable and non drying. I wear it with the matching Bomd Girl liner. I think it's worth the price, and I will be buying more shades now that I know I like the formula!\",\n",
       " \"I wasn't sure if the hype was real about this product, but I've definitely had my eye on it for years. I was finally convinced once Sephora started carrying CT and now I'm hooked. It's so soft and luxurious and the shade is perfect. I was afraid it would make me look overdone on an everyday basis, but it doesn't. I find myself reaching for it everyday! The only complaint is that it shows how dry my lips are.\",\n",
       " 'I bought Pillow Talk and Very Victoria at Brown Thomas in Ireland. By the time my dollar converted to Euro, this lipstick was $$, but worth every penny. Finally, Sephora offers Charlotte T. and I could not be more thrilled. Her stuff is LOVELY.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this item online - without trying on the shade in person. It was a risk, but I really wanted to try this lipstick that has gotten rave reviews, as my local Sephora isn’t stocking Charlotte Tilbury (at least not for now).  I’ve gotten pretty good at selecting shades for myself w/o needing to try on when a description of the color is given (i.e., taupe nude for Very Victoria). I selected this color mainly because Meghan Markle wears it and like her, I too am racially mixed. My complexion is *slightly* darker than hers, so I took a chance.\\n\\nThis lipstick’s matte formula is the best I’ve ever tried. It looks matte, but it is far from drying (I did moisturize my lips a bit before applying). I also feathered my entire lips with the liner to help deepen the lipstick color. The lip liner (Iconic Nude) was very complementary. The application was very easy - it glided onto my lips. After nearly four hours of wear my lipstick still feels feather-light on my lips, my lips don’t feel dry, and the liner has done an excellent job at preventing any bleeding. The lipstick still looks gorgeous, fresh, very beautiful and I’m happy.',\n",
       " \"Love this color! It looks very natural on my olive skin tone - almost like a tint than a thick lipstick. It goes on smoothly and doesn't feel thick on at all. The color lasts several hours, but I wouldn't say all day wear.\",\n",
       " 'My HG lippie. This shade is MLBB, and so very classy. I love it. I wish this also came in the KISSING formula, which I tend like a tad more than the Matte Revolution, due to my chronically dry lips. That said, this is pretty moisturizing for a matte lipstick...',\n",
       " 'This was my very first time trying anything from this brand. I was super excited about the packaging. However,  the product itself wasn’t satisfying as I hoped. It is not a bad lipstick, I’ll still use it when because it is a beautiful color. But I wish it lasted longer, was a bit more pigmented and had more of a matte finish.',\n",
       " 'I am in love with these lipsticks...never had a matte that felt this good & actually helps moisturize my lips.  I am Hispanic and did not think this color would look good on me but it’s gorgeous..great weekend soft pink coral on me.  Love it!!',\n",
       " 'I am very minimal and picky about lip colours that I wear. In total, all of my lipsticks/tinted lip balms are very natural pink/nude colours and I only have 5 different shades in my makeup bag (anything I don\\'t wear I\\'ve thrown out). So glad that Sephora is now carrying Charlotte Tilbury as I already own both \"very victoria\" and \"pillow talk\" from Nordstrom. Both flatter my neutral skin tone extremely well! Pillow talk is a my-lips-but-better shade with a hint of mauve pink, while \"very victoria\" is a subtle deeper shade of nude for when I get dressed up! The application of the lipsticks go on like a dream and are not nearly as drying as many matte lipsticks!',\n",
       " \"Let me start off by saying that I had very high expectations for this lipstick. (Anyone else see all the beautiful ads for CT's makeup products?) First of all, this product was not at all long-wearing and did not fade evenly. Where formula is concerned, this lipstick also performed poorly. I understand that the finish is decidedly matte...however, the finish aged my lips by settling into every fine line. I always exfoliate and moisturize my lips prior to a matte lipstick application, but even after all the prepping my lips felt quite dry and uncomfortable throughout the day. Finally, the shade Very Victoria is lovely in its own right, even if it pulled unexpectedly dark and rosy-mauve rather than lighter neutral nude on me. As my lips are naturally more pigmented, I cannot really blame the product for color inaccuracy, but it suffices to say that I have seen a few instances of this shade taking on very different undertones for some people, as compared with the official swatches released by CT. For me, a perfect alternative to this product is Bite Beauty's Amuse Bouche Chai lipstick. Chai is imperceptibly darker than Very Victoria, but otherwise a perfect color match for my lips. As far as formula goes, when applied moderately, Chai looks satiny matte and imparts a natural blurring effect to your lips. It is a hydrating lipstick that wears quite longer than Very Victoria, while also wearing evenly. I really wanted to love Very Victoria because I adore the name...I personally automatically associate it with Queen Victoria :) Apparently this lipstick is one of Duchess Meghan Markle's favorites too. I'm sad this didn't work out for me. Then again, Bite Beauty's Amuse lipsticks are a perfect testament to why I will not sulk too much over this Charlotte Tilbury lipstick. Chai is cheaper and outperforms Very Victoria any day. See attached pics for Very Victoria.\",\n",
       " \"I had purchased two different nude/pinks from CT and both were VERY orange on my fair skin, so I was reluctant to try one of her nudes again.  I'm so glad I did!  Pillow talk was the perfect nude I have been searching for.  Not too beige with just enough pink.  Goes on beautifully and stays put.\",\n",
       " \"I love CT's lipstick formulas and this is a beautiful matte formula that isn't overly drying. I have fair skin and Very Victoria is a darker nude on me. It's not my favorite lipstick formula which is why I give it 4/5 stars but would still definitely recommend if there's a particular shade that is calling to you.\",\n",
       " \"I have this lipstick in Very Victoria is it's absolutely LOVELY! I bought it from the CT store online, but I'm so glad Sephora is finally carrying her products.    \\n\\nThis lipstick is long-lasting, matte, non-drying, and absolutely stunning. \\n\\nI think it can go with any skin tone.  It's inspired by Victoria Beckham and her minimalist makeup routine.  \\n\\nMy skin isn't the same tone as Victoria's and it looks really pretty on me. Very natural, elegant and refined. \\n\\nDefinitely worth it!!!\",\n",
       " 'I was thrilled to see Sephora finally picked up the Charlotte Tilbury line, which of course included her luxurious matte bullet lipsticks. I have several I\\'ve acquired over the years, and I say \"acquired\" because one thing this line isn\\'t is cheap! \\n\\nThat being said, these matte are better than other mattes I like, like Burberry and Dior Rouge. They aren\\'t quite as good as Guerlain, but close. \\n\\nTilbury has probably THE best collection of MLBB shades in the industry. So many of these seem kind of similar, but they are different enough where you aren\\'t squinting to see the color changes from one shade to another. I have fairly pigmented lips, and Love Liberty (not heavily applied) is an excellent MLBB on me. These aren\\'t the most long-lasting lipsticks out there, but they do surprisingly well, even after a meal, and they leave a lovely stain as they gently wear away.\\n\\nI absolutely recommend this if you\\'re in the market for a MLBB bullet. And you can believe what I say, because shockingly - unlike so many other \\'reviews\\' on here - I actually put down my own cold, hard cash for the ones I own!',\n",
       " 'I have this lipstick in pillow talk and very Victoria. Very smooth and creamy upon application, however I do find it a bit drying? I’ve been alternating between this and Mac lipsticks and so far I’ve noticed that this dries to almost like a matte liquid lipstick so make sure to use a really good lip moisturizer prior. Still love this product! I haven’t tried anything from her line that I haven’t liked!!!',\n",

Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. It's not very pigmented nor is it matte. I also don't like the application of the lipstick and how it looks on the edge of the lips. I feel like you need to combine it with a lip pencil if you want a flawless application. However, it feels very luxurious and comfortable.\",\n",

I had heard good things about it, but honestly was underwhelmed with the color when I saw it in person at Sephora. I would never reach for this to even try based on how it looks in the tube. However, upon trying it on...OMG. Natural Perfection.  Looks like my lips only better. A whole lot better.  Charlotte Tilbury must use some sort of secret voodoo- because this barely there lipcolor somehow makes my eyes pop and my skin look more glowy.  How, I have no idea.  I paid full price for this at Sephora, and hope that they never stop making it.  Amazing. Seriously.',\n",

Since it's the exact shade of my lips, I don't need a liner or have to worry about touching up throughout the day. I can't recommend this enough, especially to WOC!

First of all, the packaging is SO luxe and makes you feel like a celebrity star every time you pull this gorgeous, rose gold lippie out of your purse. The formula is pretty great - similar in colour to Tarte Rainforest of the Sea colour splash in Salt Lyfe but a little more moisturizing. That said, like all lipsticks, I do feel the need to top this with a balm or it feels a little tight on my lips. And I'm not sure it has the staying power of the Bite Beauty Amuse Bouche which are very long-lasting IMHO for a cream lipstick.

I’ve tried every lipstick under the sun , and this one feels the absolute best on my lips. It glides on so nicely, not overly creamy that it’s slippy on the lips; but also not a tugging, dry matte texture. It’s really unlike any other. Once applied, it feels like I’m not wearing anything at all on my lips. The colour applies evenly and with the perfect amount of pigment, as I’ve noticed people say it lacks pigments, which I must disagree with. I’m definitely getting more colours just for the formula!!!',\n",

The texture is so lovely and comfortable and the formula actually smoothes out your lips and makes them look plump and lovely. Very Victoria is the best nude, not too ashy or warm, just the perfect shade. Every shade is beautiful and applies so well.',\n",
       " \"I've actually had the shade Pillow Talk for a while, since it was first released, and after using it numerous times I will say that overall I think this lipstick has a decent formula. It's a bit too drying if my lips are not well hydrated beforehand, but if I wear this over a nice balm or lip primer and a lip liner, it lasts a long time. This particular shade also turned out to be a little more on the pink side than I expected, but if you really love pinky nudes then I think this would be a good fit shade-wise. It definitely gives off that MLBB vibe. I don't know if I think these are quite worth the hefty price tag, but if you are curious about CT products then I think this one (along with the Pillow Talk lip liner) is a good one to try out.\",\n",

       " 'I know some people don’t like that it’s not completely matte but I do. I find it comfortable and a good compromise between non-drying and long lasting. My reasons for removing a star is that when first applied the color does not apply evenly but after a few minutes and with the formula drying a bit it looks better... for the price I would have expected better.',\n",

       " 'The perfect natural coral shade, not too bright and loud just enough color pigments to give you a fresh & glowy look. Though it has the perfect coral shade, I don’t find it moisturizing on the lips. It tends to make the cracks on the lips more visible. But you can always moisturize your lips before putting this lipstick on to make it look more dewy.',\n",

When I opened it I thought it was too brown and would not look good with my skin tone, but low and behold, I applied it, and have to admit I was wrong. This color is perfect. It's like my own lip color but better. The color is buildable for a bolder look, if you want it and goes on smoothly. I will definitely be rocking this color all year round for just a kiss of color. 10/10 will buy again.\",\n",

I am usually not one for traditional lipstick but the Matte Revolution glides on so nicely and really has a nice pop of color.

I love the look of  matte lipstick but I just hate the drying liquid formulas so this is  a dream come true. I found myself wearing this almost every day; it's pigmented enough that you don't have to use a whole lot so it's lasting pretty well. I would definitely repurchase, possibly in another colour.

I do wish I would've gotten the very Victoria color though instead because i think it would've matched my skin color a bit better but I'm still happy with this berry color!

The feeling is very nice too - very hydrating unlike some lipsticks that can dry your lips out.\\nThe smell is great as well - reminds me a lot of NARS products. This particular color is a great every day color. The others look awesome as well - definitely will be trying more from this collection!',\n",

I wear this on a golden olive skin, I have hazel eyes and black hair and yet this would look amazing on a fair skinned woman as well.

It’s a soft and comfortable matte formula that is not drying at all. It’s incredibly comfortable and instead of accentuating every line in your lip like most matte lipsticks do, it actually makes everything look smoother. It goes without saying, but the packaging is also gorgeous and very high-end as well.',\n",

       " 'Absolutely fantastic color and formula-goes on matte but it is this soft almost cloud like feel and moisturizing. it is def matte but not to the point where it looks like you rubbed chalk on your lips. I would highly recommend. Plus the color itself it’s just the bomb-perfect for work and daily wear.',\n",

Longevity is normal for a lipstick, expect to reapply after maybe 2 hours or immediately after eating. The packaging is amazing and lives up to the hype. I think for what the formula and longevity is, it is a tad overpriced.\",\n",

Plus it’s beautiful!',\n",

It lasts forever on my lips, and it doesn't make them look dry. It's a nude color, but there's just enough of a rosy-brown undertone to it that it still gives my face life. This formula is SO comfortable, and I love the shape of the bullet, which allows me to line my lips as I apply it. I'm absolutely buying more shades in this formula!\",\n",

Texture is great though, blends out imperfections and feels like cashmere. All swatches are always off, and CT always seems to got the warm side in her makeup range.',\n",

       " \"Charlotte's Matte lippies are one of a kind, and worth every penny. The formula truly is luminous and creamy, but still matte, but in a modern way. Team this lipstick with the lip liner and you have a powerful dup. These lipsticks do last very, very well. They stay a little creamy on the lips but don't transfer really. I find if you really work the lipstick in to your lips and let it settle a little, it will not really transfer. I am not a lipstick person, but these are the exception. In my opinion, these are better than Tom Ford.\",\n",

The formula of these lipsticks are beyond comparison, it’s so hydrating and long-lasting! This is a matte lipstick, but it’s so creamy and non-drying. The colors are very women of colour friendly! I understand it’s a bit pricey, but it’s definitely worth it.',\n",
       " 'I have this lipstick in multiple shades and it is one of my favorite matte formulas. It is so creamy and pigmented. It applies very evenly, the shape of the bullet is perfect for application and it has a long wear time. Both dark and light colors apply the same so its very consistent across the board.  The packaging is really luxe and stunning. I think it does the shade range well -pillow talk is basically the perfect nude and the darker colors are great for fall/winter.',\n",

I find Charlotte’s lipsticks work best with her lip liners, which is kind of a pain, but man, the pigment and pay off when you combine with lip liners is great! To be honest, I super loved this lipstick as a great flattering every day color BEFORE I started using the matching lip color so it isn’t a must. I like her lipsticks, they are extremely comfortable. This isn’t at the pigment level of a liquid lipstick, which isn’t what I want for every day softer looks. I just think this is a very pretty neutral every day shade and I’m on my second tube.',\n",
       " 'I own a lot of CT makeup, and in my experience where this brand really stands out is her lipsticks and blushes.  The mattes finishes are wonderful and long-lasting.  I love “very Victoria” for a natural professional look or “pillow talk” for a more feminine romantic look.  “Bond girl” is also a nice wearable red if you don’t want anything too bright.  I own “Penelope pink” in the kissing formula and that is a nice warm/peachy nude too.',\n",
       " 'Super creamy lipstick and easy to apply! Totally recommend.',\n",
       " 'This is the best Matte ever, mostly because it’s not really a true matte. This formula is very comfortable, creamy, and has no shine. Kind of like a thinner version of Mac’s satin (whatever formula Faux is). It doesn’t dry out my lips. I bought it in Very Victoria, which I love (there is in fact hints of purple in the brown nude which make it awesome), and the famed Pillow Talk which I don’t love—there’s not really any pink to it like in pics (my own lips are mauve, this is exactly my own lip shade with only the slightest perceptible brown deepening tinge). I can’t complain, the formula is amazing, I just wish more stores carried it so you can properly swatch. I’d probably purchase 5 more if I could swatch! I’ll add there is a hint of vanilla to the scent, but nothing like a Mac or YSL lip which almost make me ill. It also doesn’t really stain the lips, though it is opaque.',\n",
       " 'I purchased the lipstick version of the lip chest pillow talk since I was using pencil on my lips as a lip stick. My personal opinion they do not give the same results, pencil still better color and longevity than lipstick. But still a good shade and nice to have.',\n",
       " 'This lipstick feels like velvet when you put it on, and I love you can control how bold you want your lip to be. I love to do a swipe for everyday to get that stained lip look. Also, the color I got is beautiful- a really nice natural taupe. The only thing is, it doesn’t last all day, but it doesn’t dry out your lips so I’m ok with it.',\n",
       " \"Oh how I wanted to love this lipstick. The packaging is so glamorous and feels so luxurious to use, but the formulation of the lipstick is just awful. It's incredibly drying and doesn't apply evenly. After 30 min of wear my lips are looking flaky and the color has rubbed off, except where it sticks to the skin it has dried. Huge bummer.\",\n",

       " 'Best lipstick ever. So moisturising on the lips and such an incredible colour',\n",
       " 'This has to be one of my favorite lipsticks. The packaging is what initially drew me in- it has a very vintage look that takes me back to the early 90s, playing with my moms makeup. The color itself (Love Liberty) is fabulous and goes on like silk. The chisel tip is also interesting. It took a few seconds to figure how to apply it so that it doesn’t get everywhere. I love the matte finish!',\n",

       " 'This is my second Charlotte Tilbury purchase (i previously bought the Wonder Glow face primer which I returned after finding it quite underwhelming). I got Very Victoria and feel quite torn about this liptstick.\\n\\nThe pros: it is the perfect nude shade I have been searching since forever. It is creamy and not drying, and feels very comfortable on the lips. \\n\\nThe cons: i wish it was a little more matte. I’m not even sure i would call this a matte lipstick. Nowhere near as matte as a liquid matte lipstick (I guess that’s to be expected) and not as matte as the Pat McGrath Mattetrance lipsticks. Other problem with this lipstick is that it does not stay on. I had to reapply numerous times throughout the day. \\n\\nUltimately, I am keeping it because the color is just so perfect. Reapplying throughout the day may not be as big of an issue if you, like me, you are getting a nude shade. But this would not work for me if it was a bolder, darker color.',\n",
       " 'Truly a universal shade. I have a yellow undertone, so is hard to find shades that work for me. Pillow talk is a “your lips but better” kind of sitch that can be incorporated into a casual or glam look. It goes on well, stays out for a few hours, and it doesn’t dry out my lips like other matte lipsticks. Smells like vanilla. Will be buying more shades!',\n",
       " \"TLDR: Beautiful, comfortable matte lipstick if you're willing to pay the price tag.\\n\\nPros: I started using matte lipsticks as a teenager using Colorpop and as we all know, Colorpop matte lipsticks are as drying as they are cheap. This formula glides on and doesn't focus (too much) on my flaked lips). Very comfortable.\\nCons: Um hello that price tag\",\n",

       " 'High quality lipstick and the colors are all excellent.  However I’m not a fan of the packaging when compared to other lipsticks in the same price range.  This is too old school.  I prefer Marc Jacobs or NARS.  Also, I think Tilbury needs to rethink the high price.  It’s good lipstick and creamy but not longer lasting than the competition.  I’d only recommend this if you find a perfect color that you can’t live without otherwise if you’re like me, you’ll price compare and will only get this on splurges.  It’s lovely but not my favorite.',\n",
       " 'Yup, she’s a keeper. Perfect color. I especially love it paired with “supersize me” lipcheat pencil. Matte, easy to wear. I get lots of compliments when I wear, but not on my lip stick , just “you look pretty today!” Perfect, my lips but better for light to medium tan.',\n",

       " 'Really nice matte lipstick, not too drying, not moisturizing though (not that I expect that). I got pillow talk because there was so much talk about it! Definitely a nice every day color. For me, with light skin and dark hair, I could use a touch deeper of a color but it’s pretty much the same color as my lips. Looks great under glosses. Packaging is seriously gorgeous.',\n",

       "[\"I used my points to get the sample of the #103, which looks like a dusty rose on the site. I would not describe this as dusty rose, but more of a slightly dark nude/coral. It can be different on everyone, but as someone who doesn't wear strong/bright lip colors often, this one is pretty daring for me while still being work appropriate.\\n\\nI love the formulation and the packaging...it truly feels like a luxury product. Even the sample has a nice weight, and the formulation is amazing: it feels creamy but has a nice matte look to it. There is some fading towards the inside of my lips, but it stays pretty strong on the outside so a single swipe reapply is all that is needed every few hours.\\n\\n$36 is super expensive for a lipstick, but I will definitely consider buying it when the sample runs out. I wear it about once a week, so I feel like it will last me a really long time.\",\n",
       " \"Got this as a sampler. I love how it stays on. It's lovely and hydrating. However I am not a fan of creamy lipsticks. But this stays on for a longer time than i expected. So if you're into creamy lipsticks then go for it\",\n",
       " \"I'm in love with Givenchy lipsticks. They are creamy and long lasting and leave my lips soft and smooth. I bought it in Mandarin Bolero and love the reddish orange shade. I'm going back for more shades of this great lipstick and I love the case!\",\n",
       " \"Love this lipstick. Picked it up on a whim last weekend, in color 104. It's a wonderful, neutral pale plum brown, just like the description says. It's basically a soft pink-brown, but it's highly pigmented so it looks solid on the lips. Goes on smooth and fades away naturally after about 3 hours or so. Lasts long enough for me!\",\n",
       " 'I love love love this lipstick! Feels so good on my lips and looks fabulous too! Just wish there were more shades to choose from',\n",
       " 'This is the most expensive lipstick I have bought. But, the leather case is so decadent! Also, the lipstick is amazing. It wears down to a stain that stays and stays. I have actually bought 2 colors. The Brun Cachemire is perfect for everyday at the office.',\n",
       " 'Like others writing reviews, I received a deluxe sample of Rose Dressing and immediately fell in love.\\n\\nIt applies like a lip-butter, smooth and moisturizing. Because of how amazing it felt on my lips I was expecting it to perform like a lip-butter/tinted balm, with not much staying power. Boy, was I wrong.\\n\\nThis lipstick stayed on through eating/drinking and looked marvelous with no touch-ups. The staying power blew me away.\\n\\nIt was very pigmented, but very build-able so as not to be overpowering.\\n\\nAs soon as my next paycheck comes in, I am going to buy at least 2 more, full-size colors! Love this! I am so happy I got this sample.',\n",
       " 'I want every color of this lipstick now. Beautiful texture, great staying power, love the case. All around luxury lipstick. Will be back for more.',\n",
       " \"I usually wear lip glosses I have a hard time finding bright colors that look good on me. I got a sample of the mandarine color and it actually looked nice enough to keep it on for the day and really try this out. The finish was super nice satin-matte, not drying at all but also not sticky, barely could tell I was wearing it. Didn't settle into lines or smear looked sooo smooth on the lips and bright for 5hours! I was drinking water and it did not come off on the bottle. Once it started to wear off from time/eating it faded so nicely. Could not believe it looked so nice for so long. Only problem is it's so pricy but it is probably one of the nicest lipsticks I've ever worn\",\n",
       " 'Loves this formula! Gave me more reasons to Love Givenchy lipsticks as this is the most hydrating lipstick and so well pigmented! This is luxurious and the color is timeless!',\n",
       " \"The color is very pigmented and very long lasting! As a lazy person who doesn't like to reapply the lipstick all the time this is my favourite!\",\n",
       " \"I have many, many lipsticks in my collection, and this lipstick is my favorite! It goes on beautifully, with a satin finish that is rich with beautiful vivid color. The color lasts, and when it does fade it fades evenly leaving none of the 'lip ring' or smudges sometimes found with other brands. I received the Rose Dressing as a sample, and I loved it so much that I bought 2, yes two, of the same color so that I could keep one at home, one at the office and the sample in my bag. The color is that wonderful! I also bought one for a friend. I bought two other colors as well.\\n\\nThis lipstick reminds me in texture of the NARS Niagra that I have loved for years and never thought I would tire of. It turns out that I love the vividness of the color more than Niagra, and the satin finish is even more luxurious.\\n\\nThe only thing I'm not crazy about is the leather case. While I wear leather, I don't need it on my lipstick case. The case does close well, and it stays closed, even in my makeup bag in my bigger bag.\",\n",
       " 'I love how it glides on my lips! Moisturizing and long wearing! I will buy more colors!',\n",
       " 'I never believed in buying brand name lipstick but this one really changed my mind. Is the best lipstick I have ever tried in my life. Amazing, great staying power and semi matte. Beautiful color, bought rose dressing. Once again Givenchy never disappoints when it comes to make up',\n",
       " 'Beautiful, highly saturated color. This lipstick makes a statement in the case as well as on your lips. Extravagant purchase, but a great splurge.',\n",
       " \"Since I'm new to exploring the world of make-up I didnt want anything too crazy but I wanted something good quality and this lipstick totally stole my heart. It Biege Plum gave my look such a classy lift. Would definitely tell you to give it a shot.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this as a fancy gift for my mom in the Frambois Velours, it was limited edition in a burgundy case instead of the black. I had tested the color on my hand and I knew she would love it, but it seemed like a little too much for me. However, a little while later I was able to test the lipstick on my lips and I was sold. I ran out to get my own tube. This lipstick is amazing..... goes on as a creamy, moisturizing rich color and once it wears off after eating, it leaves a beautiful stain on the lips that looks almost as good as if you just put fresh lipstick on. I can go all day like that without reapplying and it looks absolutely beautiful.... I will have to choose more colors as this formula is the best I've ever used,\",\n",
       " \"I am very glad I made the trip to the store to get this one,. I don't know what great long lasting color means for others, but for me if a lipstick stays on my lips for more then 2 hours\\nwithout fading,. mission complete\",\n",
       " \"Even it's not lasting long, it doesn't dry my lips and feels good. Only 4 stars, because I believe it's overpriced.\",\n",
       " \"Le Rouge is my new favourite lipstick. First of all, the variety of shades available is outstanding. Rose Dressing is a beautiful coral without being too bright or over-the-top.

It goes on with a nice faintly glossy finish, not matte. The longevity is comparable to Chanel and leaves a pretty stain once it wears off. both are improved with using an exfoliant prior to application, I prefer Bliss Fabulips.\",\n",

Even when you're wearing an un-natural color, the lipstick looks natural on my lips. If that makes any sense. I really only have to re-apply this after I eat - drinking and going through your regular day doesn't effect it.\\n\\nAs for the COLORS - my skin tone is an NC15, so I am quite pale. Colors 201 & 202 are very similar - the descriptions of the color is very off, there is absolutely NO CORAL in them. One is a sunny pink and the other more of cool pink. They're more in the hot pink family of colors. I also own 102, which is the only color description Sephora gets right when it says its peachy beige. 103 IS NOT DUSTY ROSE - its kind of a brownish mauve where the mauve has a very slight influence. Its a nice neutral color - works on my skin tone but too much brown and not enough mauve for my taste. Have this color as a sample - wouldn't buy the full size.\",\n",

First off, the packaging is so beautiful and luxurious with the leather and stud detailing!\\n\\nWhen I first applied the lipstick, I was surprised by how light they feel on the lips. Like, I can't even feel them light! They're so moisturizing and don't dry out my easily chapped lips, so this formula will flatter lips with cracks, lines, and/or even dry flakes! I wore the lipstick around the house for a few hours to see how long it could last. I wasn't expecting much because I didn't want to get my hopes up. The first thing I noticed was after I drank water, I didn't notice any lipstick mark on the cup! I continued about my day drinking and eating with no touchups, and after a few hours I was simply blown away by how well the lipstick held up! It was as if I just applied it on! It was faded anywhere, it didn't look splotchy, it didn't feather! I have no idea how Givenchy made this lipstick formula, but this is literally the BEST one out of my entire lipstick collection! Not only is it extremely comfortable on the lips, it also lasts all day and it comes in so many beautiful shades!

A tube should last forever even with daily wear. This packaging is so gorgeous! If u like to use lip brushes, even more so. Got so fed up with MAC destroying my lips dry & cracking. Other lipsticks were nearly as much $$ & not near as lovely or their wear time was ridiculously 2 hrs. I literally maybe apply this Givenchy twice a day.

I did find that this lip stick has a \"dry\" look but really didn\\'t feel dry. I guess that\\'s the point, right? I placed lip gloss over it just because I like a more glossy look. With lip gloss over it, it did transfer. It also lasts, even with the transfer. It fades but still looks like I\\'m wearing lip stick. Again, I believe this is from the top coat of lip gloss. I am looking forward to trying it without the gloss and see how well it stays put, without transfering to things like my coffee cup or husbands lips ;) If it doesn\\'t transfer, I might end up purchasing a full size of this!

I'm a lip gloss fanatic and love flashy glittery lip glosses, often times I'd have a hard time choosing lipsticks especially for daytime wear. Most of them are too dull or too bright or just very very drying. This one is just perfect in every way! The color is not too bold but not too dull, yet could still be considered neutral, the texture is just fantastic. It's not really creamy to me but it feels very moisturizing.

But at the store I purchased the Beige Mousseline and I love it. It IS the perfect beige, not too pink, not too yellow, just right. My only complaint is that because it is matte, it is drying. My lips tend to develop those dry ridges that can make lipstick appear uneven and unattractive. I've found that I need to especially moisturize prior to using this product.

It is a perfect dusty rose, just like the description says. Texture-wise, it is quite creamy, yet very light and glides on without any effort on my side.

This is great in the sense that it is a light weight feeling lipstick with rich color but for me this formula can sometimes be patchy, sinks into the fine lines of my lips, and makes my lips look dry after the gel base has dried down.

I didn't experience it coming off in 10 mins like others wrote but it didn't look great after being on about 3 hours and that was with just drinking water not eating. It bled and seemed to go into my lip lines a bit. So while I wouldn't pan it completely I also would give it all that many stars either.

I also noticed that this time (I've ordered this one before in a different color), the leather on the case is much softer than the previous one...thinner and more worn. This time, I got the brun creatur, or 103, and it reflects poorly on its name. The color is actually a nude pink.

Some brights are hard to pull off without a bit of lip liner (especially to avoid bleeding) but with this, it's definitely not necessary.

This is a great splurge item!\",\n",

After hunting high and low, and buying way too many red lipsticks at every conceivable price point, I stumbled upon Rouge Cancan while trying it's sister color, Illicit Raspberry (a gorgeous shade in itself which looks fab on Zoe Saldana but is a bit much on me). Lo and Behold it looked even better than the original pick! It should be said though that there looked to be a red for every person out there, so if Rouge Cancan doesn't work for you, one of the others in this line probably will. It's feather-light, got great pigment but amazingly doesn't come off too heavy-looking, and makes my lips feel dreamy. Three cheers for Givenchy Rouge Interdit Satin Lipstick in Rouge Cancan!\",\n",

I would recommend a primer for lips or a lip conditioner before applying a layer of the lipstick, then add a neutral or clear gloss over it for a finish look. Its excellent for nights out or for formal occasions. Double the application for a more dramatic effect, and longer lasting.',\n",

Favorite pinks are Shocking Pink, Pretty Rose, Vamp Pink & Fantasy Pink---Vamp pink is a beautiful blue- cool toned- light pink that is sadly no longer available at Sephora but is available at Givenchy.com. Fantasy pink, a slightly darker version of Vamp pink, is a very flattering Summer pink.

I love them all (that's why I bought them, of course), but they are all sooooo drying. I pretty much have to give my lips intensive moisture therapy after wearing them, or else I will be plagued with horrid cracking and peeling zombie lips.\\nAnyway, the reviews of this lipstick were all so glowing, and many mentioned how moisturizing it was, so I decided to give it a go. It is all they say, and more! It's not going to heal major damage or anything, but if your lips are healthy and moisturized to begin with, they will stay that way--and that's all I was really hoping for.\\nThe color, as I mentioned before, is gorgeous--highly saturated, slightly shiny, and it has pretty decent staying power. You're definitely gonna have to touch up after dinner or drinks, but I find that I want to use it as much as possible anyway (both for the silky smooth texture and the tres chic container).\\nWill definitely recommend to all my friends & fam!

It smells delicious, the packaging is gorgeously stylish, and most importantly it wears GREAT. I tend to have chapped lips so it's always a constant battle not to have those little unattractive flakey pieces when I wear lipstick.

I look best in purplish-pinks, magentas, and fuschia lipsticks. Picture J-Lo when she's wearing a flattering pink lipstick, kinda like that. So I have this cool undertone thing going on. Ideal fuschia is really beautiful on me! It's very fuschia, and it has that purple-opal sheen to it that makes it look amazing on me.\\n\\nToday I bought Paradise Pink for the first time, and oh my God, it's possibly the most beautiful shade of lipstick I've ever owned. Maybe even better than Ideal Fuschia. It's not too light, and not too dark. The color pops perfectly on my skin. If you are they type who looks best in lipsticks with purple undertones, you gotta try this one! Actually the salesperson at Sephora is an extremely pale Chinese girl. Our skin tones are completely different, yet she also looks great in the kind of pinks that I do. We BOTH wear this lipstick! So don't worry about dark skin vs. light skin, it's more about whether you can wear fuschias and purplish and opalescent colors, then you'd look great in this.\\n\\nThe scent of the lipstick is nice, and the pigment is just right. The consistency is creamy, but not so opaque as to look plasticky. You can keep applying layers to make it more and more opaque, or else just a quick swipe will give sheer coverage. It's a beautiful lipstick, and the entire spectrum of colors is pretty impressive. I hope to pick up a couple more shades very soon.\",\n",

I have found only one drawback: the lipstick case is an amazing and unique design...a replica of the Givenchy logo is attached with a tiny, chic black ribbon to the bottom of the case. But, if your handbag is like mine...well...the little silver Givenchy logo broke off in less than 2 weeks...the cute little black ribbon has survived without any problem...I think there is another reviewer who experienced the same issue- just be aware that this is somewhat fragile.

In the store, it looked pretty subdued so I said \"Toss me one into my bag\" but when I got to my car and read the name, I was a bit \"eeek\" thinking it would be too bright and loud but I needn\\'t have worried.  This is a deliciously creamy, comfortable but still long-wearing lipstick and the colour is so pretty; it\\'s bright but not loud and so very flattering to the face.',\n",
       " 'This is the.perfect.lipstick for winter lips or if you have dry lips. I love the 12 Sensual Rose - it is a stunning rosy pink color with berry undertones.\\n\\nThe Interdit lipstick line is medium coverage that is slightly buildable. It has less slip than the YSL Rouge Volupte lipsticks. The formula has an excellent smoothing feel to the lips so it really helps with hydration and smoothing any lip lines. Also, when I removed my lipstick my lips were still hydrated and not flaky at all. One major plus in my book.\\n\\nThe packaging is really stunning looks-wise. It has the Givenchy silver logo on outside and inside of lipstick. Also, it has a ribbon on the bottom as well. I am not sure what the functionality of the ribbon, but it does have an easier grip to open, and maybe hang off a hook for easy access.\\n\\nOverall, if you love a satin finish that is nourishing and hydrating for the lips, then you will absolutely love the Rouge Interdit Satin Lipstick line!

I top it with Laura Mercier lip gloss in PInk Diamond, which is a sparkly light pink. I have very fair skin and my lips can be reddish so I like to tone down the redness in them and this pale pink is the only one I have found that\\'s light enough to achieve that. It would make a great pale pink shimmery \"nude lip\" for many skin tones I\\'m sure. It\\'s also good motivation not to be snacking too much when you\\'re wearing $28 lipstick, haha!

You may want to try and swatch in store if possible.\\n\\nThe formula is a treat to wear, smooth and creamy and moisturizing. I've put this on in lieu of lip balm before, and my lips did just fine. Nothing lasts on me so I can't really judge wear (I drink water all the time so things wear off) but this does seem a bit longer-wearing than some other lightweight lipsticks.

I've tried blotting and layering but it doesn't achieve the bold look I was hoping for when I bought this color. Too much work for too little payoff.

For instance I would have thought that 06 precious rose was too light and too pink for my dark skin, but when I tried on the sample one day while I had some friends over I got so many compliments. Even my boyfriend (he hates when I wear lipgloss, complains that it gets on him when we kiss) but even he highly approved of the shade on me and told me that I should buy it.\\n\\nI am very pleased with this color, and in the future I will pay more attention to the free samples offered. On me the precious rose is not a bright pink, but subtle and warm. Very adult and a surprisingly large compliment on my brown skin.

It kept my lips inordinately comfortable all day long, even after it had worn off. As someone with terribly dry skin--lips included--this was such a wonderful aspect. It made me love the lipstick even more.\\n\\nIt's a joy to wear and to apply and the colour choices the lipstick comes in are glorious. All sorts of colours in all colour spectrum variations.\\n\\nI myself can only wear cool colours so the warmer-than-expected colour of Ideal Fuchsia could've been disastrous. But surprisingly, it wasn't. The hint of warmth actually put a bit of the right sort of warmth into my skin. The effect was oh-so beautiful.\\n\\nThe case is the epitome of lovely. Givenchy's case was something the first of a kind and so many other companies have emulated it...while Urban Decay comes the closest in terms of aesthetic beauty, Givenchy still does it best. A sleek black lacquered case-top with 'GIVENCHY' in silver lettering, the lipstick tube itself in gleaming lightweight silver metal, engraved with Givenchy's somewhat ancient-grecianesqe 4-G logo, a dainty elegant ribbon looped into a pull-tab used to extract the lipstick from the case....beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.\\n\\nI might be a bit biased because I've always been such a Givenchy fan, but this lipstick is made of total win. It's probably my favourite lipstick I've ever tried. In general, I hate lipstick because it dries my lips so terribly, the colour palettes are typically terribly-limited to beiges, browns and reds and so many of them taste just terrible. Not this one. In fact, this lipstick is the exact 360° opposite of everything I've just listed. It's simply the incarnation of perfection.\\n\\nI will most definitely be repurchasing this lipstick and in the interum, I'll be buying all sorts of different colours in the line, not to mention the Interdit Shine variation. I can't wait.\",\n",
       " \"The Givenchy section was my first stop for lipsticks and I found the perfect color for me--Beige Champagne. I absolutely loved the color on my lips and is very buildable. It can easily be worn alone or with a gloss and definitely felt moisturizing and has no taste. However, these lipsticks are pricey so I kept a swatch of this color on my hand as I wandered throughout the Sephora store. Sure enough, I was able to find two other lipsticks that exactly matched this one, but for lower prices. Overall, Givenchy's Satin Lipsticks are wonderful products, but I just want to put it out there that there are cheaper alternatives.\",\n",
